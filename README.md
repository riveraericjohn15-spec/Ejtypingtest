# Personal Typing Test Website - v1

This is a personal project I created to refresh my coding skills.

## What it does

* A typing test with live WPM (Words Per Minute) and accuracy tracking.
* Features virtual keys highlighting (not a full virtual keyboard) to show the keys you press.
* Disables paste to encourage honest typing practice.
* Shows top 3 rankings with your current position and performance details like WPM and time.
* Simple, clean, and user-friendly interface.

## Why I made this

* It’s primarily for my personal use, but I’m sharing it here in case others want to try it out or give feedback.

## Future plans

* Improve the design and add more features.
* Enhance analytics and customization options.
* Optimize performance and accessibility.

## How to use

* Clone or download this repository.
* Open `index.html` in your browser.
* Start typing and see your stats live!

## Feedback

If you find any issues or have suggestions, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
